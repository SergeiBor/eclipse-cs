After installation of this plugin eclipse must be restarted with the -clean option at least once.
That is: <path-to-my-eclipse-install>/eclipse.exe -clean

The plugin version 4.x.x does not support eclipse 2.x.x any more. 
Make sure you got an eclipse 3.0 or higher installation you are installing this plugin to.

Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin v4.0.90 (4.1.0 beta)
----------------------------------------------

Version 4.1.0 introduces the "local configuration" scheme which allows to set up check configurations private to a project.
The check configuration data will be stored inside the projects .checkstyle file.
This allows for a true self contained Checkstyle setup for projects, further enhancing teamworking support as
no additional setup in the developers workspace is required.
At the same time the well known "per workspace" setup of Checkstyle configurations (now called "global configurations")
remains intact, allowing for set up of check configurations that can be used by multiple project.

There are now new ways to resolve properties within Checkstyle configuration files:
 * properties can be resolved from Classpath variables
 * properties can be resolved from System/Environment properties (passed into eclipse via the -D paramter)
 * Reintroduced in 4.1.0 is that you can input properties as you set up the configuration. The plugin will find
   unresolved properties and asks for you to input the values.
   
The way Project relative configurations work has changed a bit. Now they are relative to exactly one project
instead of possibly multiple projects. This achieves a more expectable behaviour and allows new configuration
deployment schemes, for instance to use a configuration file that lies relative to another project in the 
workspace.

The internal Checkstyle logging (error log) was bridged with the Eclipse Error Log.
This way exceptions thrown by Checkstyle checks (standard or custom) appear in the Error Log View.
This greatly enhances debugging of custom checks used with the plugin.

A lot of other features have been implemented and bugs been resolved, as you can judge from the list below:
