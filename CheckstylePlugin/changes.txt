Release alpha4:

This release revises much of the inner workings of the checkstyle plugin as well as the plugin GUI.
Currently there is no updated user doc, this will be included with the 4.0.0 final release.
Be warned that some things might work slightly different now (especially the GUI). But it should not
be too hard to figure out.

* Plugin now uses plain checkstyle configuration files
* Now able to use checkstyle configuration files located somewhere in the file systems (External Configuration)
* Possible to use checkstyle configuration files from a remote URL (Remote Configuration)
* Possible to use project relative checkstyle configurations (Project Relative Configuration)
* ALL checkstyle modules are now supported including Header Checks, Fileset Checks (for instance StrictDuplicateCheck) and Filters
* All modules can be configured from the GUI
* Completely reworked the configuration GUI
* Added 'Default' option to the module (rule) configuration dialog so that default settings can easily be restored
* Modules can now be easily enabled/disabled using a checkbox
* Checkstyle tokens can now be translated into a more readable form in the configuration GUI
* Existing check configurations (old format) are migrated to the new configuration format
* Improved the annotations for eclipse editors so that errors and infos are shown in a similar way
* Added filter to exclude files from non source directories
