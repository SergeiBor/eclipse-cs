4.2.0

Bridged internal Checkstyle logging (error log) with the Eclipse Error Log.
This way exceptions thrown by Checkstyle checks (standard or custom) appear in the Error Log View.
This greatly enhances debugging of custom checks used with the plugin.

* Modules can now be easily enabled/disabled using a checkbox
