Checkstyle Plug-in</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=4><FONT FACE="Arial">Introduction</FONT></FONT></B><A HREF="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/"><BR>Checkstyle</A>
is a development tool written by Oliver Burn to help you ensure that
your Java code adheres to a set of coding standards. Checkstyle does
this by inspecting your Java source code and pointing out items that
deviate from a defined set of coding rules. The full Checkstyle
distribution is included with the plug-in. In addition to using the
Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in you can also use Checkstyle from the
command line or as part of an Ant build.<BR><BR>With the Checkstyle
Eclipse plug-in your code is constantly inspected for problems.
Within the Eclipse workbench you are notified of problems via the
task window and source code markers just as you would see with
compiler errors or warnings. The current release of the Eclipse
plug-in runs the tree-walker checks from Checkstyle. These checks
only check individual Java source files. A future release of the
plug-in may include Checkstyle checks that span across multiple
files.</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=4><FONT FACE="Arial">Download &amp; Installation</FONT></FONT></B><BR>The
Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in can be downloaded from the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-cs/">Eclipse
Checkstyle plug-in's SourceForge project page</A>. The download
package consists of a single zip file that contains both the
Checkstyle plug-in and the Checkstyle core engine.<BR><BR>Once you
have downloaded the distribution zip file extract its contents.
First, exit from Eclipse. Next, copy the
<FONT FACE="Courier New">com.atlassw.tools.eclipse.checkstyle_</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&lt;version&gt;</FONT></I>
folder to your Eclipse plug-in folder and restart Eclipse. That's all
there is to it, you are now ready to run Checkstyle. 
</P>
<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Important Note:</FONT></I></B> If you
encounter problems after the installation - for instance eclipse not
detecting the newly installed plugin &ndash; you should try to start
eclipse with the <I>-clean </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">option
( /myPathToEclipse/eclipse.exe -clean).</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Important
Note:</FONT></I></B> As of plug-in release 4.0.0 only Eclipse 3.0 and
newer is supported. Eclipse 2.x.x support is discontinued. Please use
older plug-in versions with Eclipse 2.x.x.</P>
<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Important Note:</FONT></I></B> Eclipse
2.0.x is no longer supported as of plug-in release 3.4.0.</P>
<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Important Note:</FONT></I></B> If you
had a pre 3.1.0 version of the Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in installed
you will need to remove it before installing the new plug-in. Also,
remove any .checkstyle files from the root of your projects, these
files are not compatible with this version of the plug-in. After
removing these files be sure and refresh your workspace so that
Eclipse is aware that they have been removed.</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=4><FONT FACE="Arial">What Next?</FONT></FONT></B><BR>See
the on-line help within Eclipse for more information on how to
configure and use Checkstyle. To get to the on-line help go the <FONT FACE="Arial">Help</FONT>
menu and select <FONT FACE="Arial">Help Contents</FONT>. Within the
help window select the <FONT FACE="Arial">Checkstyle</FONT> topic in
