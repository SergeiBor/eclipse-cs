<p><b>Q:</b>
        <br />
        I just dropped plug-in version x.x.x in Eclipse (replacing version z.z.z, which was working great) and I&#39;m having
        some trouble using it. <br />
        When I go to Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Checkstyle an error occurs.<br />
		I looked into the Eclipse error log and found some NoClassDefFoundExceptions. Whats going on?
        </p>
<p><b>A:</b>
        <br />
        If you install the plug-in from the downloaded distributable (not via the Update Site) over an older version of the
        plug-in, Eclipse may have difficulties detecting the change and updating its cached information about the plug-in. <br />
        To force Eclipse to update this information you have to restart Eclipse with the <i>-clean</i> option. <br />
        For instance: <i>&lt;path-to-my-eclipse&gt;\eclipse.exe -clean</i></p>

        <p><b>Q: <br />
        </b> I wrote a new Checkstyle rule. I know it works because I tested it. I created a .jar file with .class files
        and with messages.properties. <br />
        I can&#39;t plug-in my rule to Eclipse - i don&#39;t know how do it ?</p>
<p><b>A: <br />
        </b> It is now documented what to do to integrate custom checks with the plug-in. See
        <a
        href="extending_custom_checks.html">here</a>
        .</p>
<hr />

        <p><b>Q:</b>
        <br />
        I use the Checkstyle Plug-in with my project which has only 1.000.000 source files. <br />
        Using Checkstyle on this project is extremely slow even after I upgraded to 4 GB memory! <br />
        What to do? (This question is a bit dramatized by the FAQ author)</p>
<p><b>A:</b>
        <br />
        Yes, checking such a project takes some time and memory resources. <br />
        You should try to decrease the number of files that are actually checked by using
        <a
        href="advanced_file_sets.html">file sets</a>
        and
        <a href="advanced_filters.html">filter</a>
        .</p>
<hr />

        <p><b>Q:</b>
        <br />
        I think you have done a really good job with your plug-in! <br />
        We are using it in our company with xxx developers and it helped us to improve the quality of our code big time! <br />
        I would like to send you some bottles of beer but I don&#39;t know your addresses. (OK I admit this question was
        never asked...)</p>
<p><b>A:</b>
        <br />
        Thank You for your kind words. Since it wouldn&#39;t be wise to publish our addresses on the net we would appreciate
        a donation for the project. <br />
        You can make donations to the Checkstyle Plug-in Project
        <a
        href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=80344" target="_blank">here</a>
        . <br />
        Please do not overlook the very great work of the Checkstyle (Core) Project â€“ they are laying out the base on which
        the plug-in relies. <br />
        Since their project has not opted in for donations please drop them a kind note how you like their work. <br />
