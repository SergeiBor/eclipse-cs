        <h2>Working with a Team Repository</h2>
        <p>Most software projects involve more then one person and a team repository is used to
            manage and share files among the team members. <br/> The Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in
            supports working in a team environment with a repository. <br/> The following discussion
            provides the information you need to know when working in a team environment.</p>
        <p>Check Configurations are defined in your workspace preferences. Since they are part of
            your workspace&#39;s preferences they are stored on your local file system by
            Eclipse in a location that is not shared via your team repository. To share a Check
            Configuration with other team members have one team member define the Check
            Configuration to be used by the team and then distribute that Checkstyle configuration
            file to all the team members.</p>
        <p>One approach for distributing the file is to put it on your companies intranet server.
            Have each team member using this configuration by creating a remote check configuration
            using the file&#39;s intranet URL.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/remote_configuration.png" alt="Remote Configuration"/>
        </p>
        <p>Another option to store the Checkstyle configuration file within your eclipse project and
            put it under version control. Have each team member using this configuration by creating
            a project relative check configuration.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/project_relative_configuration.png" alt="Project Relative
                Configuration"/>
        </p>
        <p>This even allows you to have project specific configurations in each project with the
            same configuration file name. Each if these project use then the same project specific
            configuration set up in the preferences. <br/> When Checkstyle is invoked on the project
            the specific configuration file is loaded and used with the project.</p>
        <p>Once Checkstyle is configured for a project via the project&#39;s properties page the
            plug-in will create a file named .checkstyle in root of the project. This file can then
            be shared with all the team members via the repository just as the .project and
            .classpath files are. <br/> When a team member checks out the project from the
            repository the Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-In will be already set up for this project - no
            additional setup steps are required.</p>
        <p><b>
                <i>Important Note:</i>
            </b> The team working support has been improved with the plug-in version 4.0.0 beta6. In
            order to get the new features the .checkstyle file for your project need to be rewritten
            once by the new plug-in version. To achieve this just change a small thing within the
            plug-ins project properties, Apply the change and then undo it again.</p>
