A lot of effort has gone into testing the Checkstyle plug-in, but like all software things can and do go wrong. The following are some tips that may help in troubleshooting when things go wrong and some guidelines on reporting bugs to help get them fixed.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Check the log file. The file <i>&lt;workspace root&gt;</i>/.metadata/.log may contain additional diagnostic messages that can help determine the source of the problem.</li>
	<li>Verify that the .checkstyle file in the project's root directory is writeable when editing the project's File Sets. Some version control systems don't know to make this file writeable and the plug-in may fail trying to write your updated settings to it.</li>
	<li>Verify that the Check Configuration referred to in your File Set configuration exists in your workspace. Because the .checkstyle file is often shared through a team repository its possible for the file to be updated by one team member and propagated to another team member when he synchronizes with the repository. The Check Configuration name in the File Set must match one of the Check Configurations defined in your workspace.</li>
</ol>
