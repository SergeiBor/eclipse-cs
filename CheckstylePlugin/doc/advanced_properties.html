        <h2>Expanding Properties within Checkstyle configuration files</h2>
<p>Checkstyle contains a
        <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config.html#Properties">feature</a>
        that lets you define module properties in a way that they can expanded dynamically when the configuration is loaded. <br />
        Such a property is defined using the well known <span class="code-blue">${property_name}</span> notation.</p>
<p>Normally these properties are resolved from command line or ant properties. <br />
        Of course this does not work within the plug-in so using a checkstyle configuration containing such expandable properties
            will probably fail.</p>
<p>But as you might have thought there are some features in place to help you out in this case.</p>
<p>First there are some properties that are automatically expanded by the plug-in:</p>
<ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="code-blue">${basedir}</span> - gets mapped to the current project directory</p>
</li>
<li>
                <p><span class="code-blue">${project_loc}</span> - same as <span class="code-blue">${basedir}</span></p>
</li>
<li>
                <p><span class="code-blue">${workspace_loc}</span> - gets mapped to the current Eclipse workspace directory</p>
</li>
<li>
                <p><span class="code-blue">${config_loc}</span> &amp; <span class="code-blue">${samedir}</span> - get mapped to the directory the configuration file lies
                    in</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have more properties that need to be expanded there is another feature for you.</p>
<p>Using External, Remote or Project Relative Configuration you can write the properties you need to be expanded into a <span class="code-blue">.properties</span> file
    that lies in the same directory as the configuration file and has the same name. <br />
        For instance:</p>
<p><span class="code-blue">D:/path/to/my/config/myCheckConfiguration.xml</span>
        <br />
        can resolve properties defined in <br />
         <span class="code-blue">D:/path/to/my/config/myCheckConfiguration.properties</span></p>
<p>Expandable properties within your configuration file will then be resolved from the corresponding <span class="code-blue">.properties</span> file.</p>
<p>Note that the plug-in supports &#39;property chaining&#39; to let you use &#39;properties within properties&#39;. <br />
        With this feature you can write something like this in your <span class="code-blue">.properties</span> file: <br />
         <span class="code-blue">property1=abc <br />
    property2=${property1}def</span>
        <br />
        Using <span class="code-blue">${property2}</span> in your checkstyle configuration will then be resolved to: <span class="code-blue">abcdef</span></p>
