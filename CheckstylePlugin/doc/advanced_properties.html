    <h2>Expanding Properties within Checkstyle configuration files</h2>

    <p>Checkstyle contains a <a href="csdocs/config.html#Properties">feature</a> that lets you define module properties
    in a way that they can expanded dynamically when the configuration is loaded.<br />
     Such a property is defined using the well known <i>${property_name}</i> notation.</p>

    <p>Normally these properties are resolved from command line or ant properties.<br />
     Of course this does not work within the plugin &ndash; so using a checkstyle configuration containing such
    expandable properties will probably fail.</p>

    <p>But as you might have thought there are some features in place to help you out in this case.</p>

    <p>First there are some properties that are automatically expanded by the plugin:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><i>${basedir}</i> &ndash; gets mapped to the current project directory</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><i>${project_loc}</i> &ndash; same as <i>${basedir}</i></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><i>${workspace_loc}</i> &ndash; gets mapped to the current Elipse workspace directory</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
     

    <p>If you have more properties that need to be expanded there is another featue for you.</p>

    <p>Using External, Remote or Project Relative Configuration you can write your the properties you need expanded
    into a <i>.properties</i> file that lies in the same directory as the configuration file and has the same
    name.<br />
     For instance:</p>

    <p><i>D:/path/to/my/config/myCheckConfiguration.xml</i><br />
     can resolve properties defined in<br />
     <i>D:/path/to/my/config/myCheckConfiguration.properties</i></p>

    <p>Expandable properties within your configuration file will then be resolved from the corresponding
    <i>.properties</i> file.</p>

    <p>Note that the plugin supports 'property chaining' to let you use 'properties within properties'.<br />
     With this feature you can write something like this in your <i>.properties</i> file:<br />
     <i>property1=abc<br />
     property2=${property1}def</i><br />
     Using <i>${property2}</i> in your checkstyle configuration will then be resolved to: <i>abcdef</i></p>
