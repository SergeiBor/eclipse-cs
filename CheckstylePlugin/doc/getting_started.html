<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Getting Started</font></b><br>
There are only a few things you need to do to get up and running
using the Checkstyle plug-in. The first thing is to understand a few
basic concepts about how the plug-in works.</p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Basic Concepts</font></b><br>
The Checkstyle plug-in works with two basic objects, a Check
Configuration and a File Set. A Check Configuration specifies which check rules you want to inspect your code, the configuration settings for each rule, and the severity level of the message if the rule finds a problem. Once defined a Check Configuration is saved in your workspace and can be used accross multiple projects. The Checkstyle plug-in comes with one or more Check Configurations already
defined. To see/modify the pre-defined Check Configurations or to create your own go to <font
	face="Arial Narrow"><b>Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Checkstyle</b></font>.</p>
<p>A File Set is a collection of files within one project that need to be checked with the same Check Configuration. A File Set is defined using regular expressions to select the files to include and exclude from the File Set. A File Set also references the Check Configuration to use when checking its files. File Sets are defined for each project by right clicking on the project and selecting <font
	face="Arial Narrow"><b>Properties -&gt; Checkstyle</b></font>.</p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial">My First Code Check</font></b><br>The following steps will guide you through your first code check using Checkstyle.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Review the pre-defined Check Configurations, modify them, or define you own. For detailed instructions see <a
		href="configuring.html">Configuring Check Configurations</a>.</li>
	<li>Enable Checkstyle on your project by creating one or more File Sets. For detailed instructions see <a
		href="config_file_sets.html">Configuring File Sets</a>.</li>
	<li>Upon closing the project properties window a new build should be triggered that will include a code check. If a build is not triggered automatically select <font
		face="Arial Narrow"><b>Project -&gt; Rebuild Project</b></font>.</li>
	<li>Any problems Checkstyle finds in your Java source code will be listed in the Tasks view.</li>
</ol>
