Checkstyle Plug-in</b></font></p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Introduction</font></b><br>
Checkstyle is a development tool written by Oliver Burn to help you ensure that your Java code adheres to a set of coding standards. Checkstyle does this by inspecting your Java source code and pointing out items that deviate from a defined set of coding rules. The full Checkstyle distribution is included with the plug-in. In addition to using the Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in you can also use Checkstyle from the command line or as part of an Ant build. For more information about using Checkstyle outside of Eclipse see the <A
	href="csdocs/index.html">Checkstyle documentation</A>.<BR>
<BR>
With the Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in your code is constantly inspected for problems. Within the Eclipse workbench you are notified of problems via the task window and source code markers just as you would see with compiler errors or warnings. The current release of the Eclipse plug-in runs
the tree-walker checks from Checkstyle. These checks only check individual Java source files. A future release of the plug-in may include Checkstyle checks that span across multiple files.</p>
<p><b><i>Important Note:</i></b> If you had a previous version of the Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in installed remove it before installing the new plug-in. Also, remove any .checkstyle files from the root of your projects, these files are not compatible with this version of the plug-in. If you remove these files be sure and refresh your workspace the next time you start Eclipse.</p>
