    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p><a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a> is a development tool written by Oliver Burn to help
    you ensure that your Java code adheres to a set of coding standards. Checkstyle does this by inspecting your Java
    source code and pointing out items that deviate from a defined set of coding rules. The full Checkstyle
    distribution is included with the Checkstyle plug-in. In addition to using the Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in you can
    also use Checkstyle from the command line or as part of an Ant build. For more information about using Checkstyle
    outside of Eclipse see the <a href="csdocs/index.html">Checkstyle documentation</a>.<br />
    <br />
     With the Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in your code is constantly inspected for problems. Within the Eclipse workbench
    you are notified of problems via the Eclipse Problems View and source code annotations just as you would see with
    compiler errors or warnings.</p>

    <h2>Download &amp; Installation</h2>

    <p>The Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in can be downloaded from the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-cs/">Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in's SourceForge project page</a>. The
    download package consists of a single zip file that contains both the Checkstyle plug-in and the Checkstyle core
    engine.<br />
    <br />
     Once you have downloaded the distribution zip file extract its contents. First, exit from Eclipse. Next, copy the
    <font face="Courier New">com.atlassw.tools.eclipse.checkstyle_</font><i>&lt;version&gt;</i> folder to your Eclipse
    plug-in folder and restart Eclipse. That's all there is to it, you are now ready to run Checkstyle.</p>

    <p><b><i>Important Note:</i></b> If you did not use the update site to install the plug-in please make sure to
    restart Eclipse with the <i>-clean</i> option at least once. This is because Eclipse caches a lot of information
    about plug-ins. In case you just updated the plugin from a previous version this information cached by Eclipse is
    not up to date - resulting in the plugin failing with ClassNotFoundExceptions and other serious issues.</p>

    <p><b><i>Important Note:</i></b> As of plug-in release 4.0.0 only Eclipse 3.0 and newer is supported. Eclipse 2.x.x
    support is discontinued. Please use older plug-in versions with Eclipse 2.x.x.</p>
