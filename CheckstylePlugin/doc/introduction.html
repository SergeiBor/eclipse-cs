    <h1>Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p><a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a> is a development tool written by Oliver Burn to help
    you ensure that your Java code adheres to a set of coding standards. Checkstyle does this by inspecting your Java
    source code and pointing out items that deviate from a defined set of coding rules. The full Checkstyle
    distribution is included with the Checkstyle plug-in. In addition to using the Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in you can
    also use Checkstyle from the command line or as part of an Ant build. For more information about using Checkstyle
    outside of Eclipse see the <a href="csdocs/index.html">Checkstyle documentation</a>.<br />
    <br />
     With the Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in your code is constantly inspected for problems. Within the Eclipse workbench
    you are notified of problems via the Eclipse Problems View and source code annotations just as you would see with
    compiler errors or warnings.</p>

    <p><b><i>Important Note:</i></b>If you did not use the update site to install the plug-in please make sure
    to restart Eclipse with the -clean option at least once. This is because Eclipse caches a lot of information about
    plug-ins. In case you just updated the plugin from a previous version this information cached by Eclipse is not up
    to date - resulting in the plugin failing with ClassNotFoundExceptions and other serious issues.</p>
