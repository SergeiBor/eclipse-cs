        <h2>Configuration types</h2>
<p>Since the 4.0.0 release the Checkstyle Plug-in uses plain Checkstyle configuration files. For easier reuse of existing
    Checkstyle configurations and to support some common use cases different Configuration types were introduced into the
    plug-in. The following section explains the existing configuration types</p>
<h3>Built-in Configuration</h3>
<p>Built-in configurations come shipped with the plug-in (or an extending fragment). They can not be edited nor deleted. <br />
        You can create an own configuration based on a built-in (or any other) configuration by copying the configuration. <br />
        Please note that you cannot create new Built-In configurations.</p>
<h3>Internal Configuration</h3>
<p>Internal configurations are stored within the Eclipse metadata. Use an internal configuration if you don&#39;t want to
    manage the location of your configuration by yourself. <br />
        If you ever need the internal configuration outside the plug-in use the export functionality. <br />
        Internal configurations can be edited and deleted.</p>
<h3>External Configuration</h3>
<p>Use this configuration type if you have a Checkstyle configuration file outside of eclipse in your file system. <br />
        The plug-in just points to this configuration file and uses it from its location. <br />
        External configurations can be edited if the configuration file is write enabled. <br />
        If you delete an External Configuration from the plug-in the external configuration file will NOT be deleted.</p>
<h3>Remote Configuration</h3>
<p>This configuration type can be used if you want to publish your Checkstyle configuration on a web server and have all
    developer in your company use it. <br />
        A Remote Configuration can not be edited but can be removed from the plug-in.</p>
<h3>Project Relative Configuration</h3>
<p>If you got a several projects with specific Checkstyle configurations under the same relative path stored within these
    projects you might want to use the Project Relative Configuration type. <br />
        You must provide the project relative location of the configuration file. <br />
        If then project A is checked the Checkstyle configuration file is used from project A. If project B is checked the
        configuration is used from project B. <br />
        This is particular useful if you already using Checkstyle with your Ant-Build for these projects.
