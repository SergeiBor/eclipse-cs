    <h2>Configuration types</h2>
    Since the 4.0.0 release the Checkstyle Plug-in uses plain Checkstyle configuration files. For easier reuse of
    existing Checkstyle configurations and to support some common use cases different Configuration types were
    introduced into the plug-in. The following section explains the existing configuration types 

    <h3>Built-in Configuration</h3>
    Built-in configurations come shipped with the plug-in. They can not be edited nor deleted.<br />
    You can create an own configuration based on a built-in (or any other) configuration by copying the
    configuration.<br />
    Please note that you cannot create new Built-In configurations. 

    <h3>Internal Configuration</h3>
    Internal configurations are stored within the Eclipse metadata. Use an internal configuration if you don't want to
    manage the location of your configuration by yourself.<br />
    If you ever need the internal configuration outside the plug-in use the export functionality.<br />
    Internal configurations can be edited and deleted. 

    <h3>External Configuration</h3>
    Use this configuration type if you have a Checkstyle configuration file outside of eclipse in your file
    system.<br />
    The plug-in just points to this configuration file and uses it from its location.<br />
    External configurations can be edited if the configuration file is write enabled.<br />
    If you delete an External Configuration from the plug-in the external configuration file will NOT be deleted. 

    <h3>Remote Configuration</h3>
    This configuration type can be used if you want to publish your Checkstyle configuration on a web server and have
    all developer in your company use it.<br />
    A Remote Configuration can not be edited but can be removed from the plug-in. 

    <h3>Project Relative Configuration</h3>
    If you got a several projects with specific Checkstyle configurations under the same relative path stored within
    these projects you might want to use the Project Relative Configuration type.<br />
    You must provide the project relative location of the configuration file.<br />
    If then project A is checked the Checkstyle configuration file is used from project A. If project B is checked the
    configuration is used from project B.<br />
    This is particular useful if you already using Checkstyle with your Ant-Build for these projects.
