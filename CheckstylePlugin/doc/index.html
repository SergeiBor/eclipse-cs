Checkstyle Plug-in</b></font></p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Introduction</font></b><br>
Checkstyle is a development tool written by Oliver Burn to help you ensure that your Java code adheres to a set of coding standards. Checkstyle does this by inspecting your Java source code and pointing out items that deviate from a defined set of coding rules. The full Checkstyle distribution is included with the plug-in. In addition to using the Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in you can also use Checkstyle from the command line or as part of an Ant build.<BR>
<BR>
With the Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in your code is constantly inspected for problems. Within the Eclipse workbench you are notified of problems via the task window and source code markers just as you would see with compiler errors or warnings. The current release of the Eclipse plug-in runs
the tree-walker checks from Checkstyle. These checks only check individual Java source files. A future release of the plug-in may include Checkstyle checks that span across multiple files.</p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Download &amp; Installation</font></b><br>
The Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in can be downloaded from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-cs/">SourceForge project page</a>. The download package consists of a single zip file that contains both the Checkstyle plug-in and the Checkstyle core engine.<br>
<br>
Once you have downloaded the distribution zip file extract its contents. Copy the <font face="Courier New">com.atlassw.tools.eclipse.checkstyle_</font><font
	face="Times New Roman"><i>&lt;version&gt;</i></font> folder to your Eclipse plug-in folder and restart Eclipse. That's all there is to it, you are now ready to run Checkstyle.
