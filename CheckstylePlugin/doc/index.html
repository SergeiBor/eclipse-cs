		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			<a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a> is a development tool written by Oliver Burn to help you ensure that your Java code adheres to a set of coding standards.
        Checkstyle does this by inspecting your Java source code and pointing out items that deviate from a defined set of
        coding rules. The full Checkstyle distribution is included with the Checkstyle plug-in. In addition to using the
        Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in you can also use Checkstyle from the command line or as part of an Ant build. For more
        information about using Checkstyle outside of Eclipse see the
			<a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle documentation</a>.</p>
		<p>With the Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in your code is constantly inspected for problems. Within the Eclipse workbench
        you are notified of problems via the Eclipse Problems View and source code annotations just as you would see with
        compiler errors or warnings.</p>
		<h2>Download &amp; Installation</h2>


		<p>The first way to install the Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in is via the <a href="http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/update">update site</a>.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Within Eclipse go to <i>Help-&gt;Software Updates-&gt;Find and Install</i></li>

			<li>Choose <i>Search for new features to install</i> and press <i>Next</i></li>

			<li>Create a <i>New Remote Site...</i></li>

			<li>Input a name to your liking (for instance <i>Checkstyle Plugin</i>) and input the following URL: <span class="code-blue">http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/update</span></li>

			<li>Click your way through the following pages to install the plug-in.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Alternativly the Checkstyle Eclipse Plug-in can be downloaded from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-cs/">Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in's SourceForge project page</a>. The
                        download package consists of a single zip file that contains both the Checkstyle Plug-in and the Checkstyle core
                        engine.</p>
                        
		<p>Once you have downloaded the distribution zip file extract its contents. First, exit from Eclipse. Next, copy the
			<span class="code-blue">com.atlassw.tools.eclipse.checkstyle_<b>&lt;version&gt;</b></span> folder to your Eclipse
                        plug-in folder and restart Eclipse. That's all there is to it, you are now ready to run Checkstyle.</p>


		<p>
			<b>
				<i>Important Note:</i>
			</b>If you did not use the update site to install the plug-in please make sure to
                        restart Eclipse with the <span class="code-blue">-clean</span> option at least once. This is because Eclipse caches a lot of information
                        about plug-ins. In case you just updated the plugin from a previous version this information cached by Eclipse is
                        not up to date - resulting in the plugin failing with ClassNotFoundExceptions and other serious issues.</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				<i>Important Note:</i>
			</b>As of plug-in release 4.0.0 only Eclipse 3.0 and newer is supported. Eclipse 2.x.x support
    is discontinued. Please use older plug-in versions with Eclipse 2.x.x. - downloadable from the
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-cs/">SourceForge Project Page</a>

		<h2>Support this project</h2>
		<p>Developing and testing all the nifty features you see in the plug-in takes a considerable amount of time. <br/>
        This project is developed by its team members purely in their free time - so we're not in for the money but the
        fun. <br/>
        However, if you are using the Checkstyle Plug-in in your production environment you are probably saving a lot of
        money because of the increased code quality that the plug-in helps you to enforce. <br/>
        So if you really like this plug-in you might want to consider a donation for the Checkstyle Plug-in Project. <br/>
        Donations can my made via PayPal ranging from $5 to $250. More info about donating to this project can be found
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=80344">here</a>. <br/>
        Thank you! <br/>
        The Checkstyle Plug-in dev team</p>
