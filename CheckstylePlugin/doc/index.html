			<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Introduction</font></b><br>
			<a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a> is a development tool written by Oliver Burn to help you
			ensure that your Java code adheres to a set of coding standards.
			Checkstyle does this by inspecting your Java source code and pointing
			out items that deviate from a defined set of coding rules. The full
			Checkstyle distribution is included with the plug-in. In addition to
			using the Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in you can also use Checkstyle from
			the command line or as part of an Ant build.<br>
			<br>
			With the Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in your code is constantly inspected
			for problems. Within the Eclipse workbench you are notified of
			problems via the task window and source code markers just as you
			would see with compiler errors or warnings. The current release of
			the Eclipse plug-in runs the tree-walker checks from Checkstyle.
			These checks only check individual Java source files. A future
			release of the plug-in may include Checkstyle checks that span across
			multiple files.</p>
			<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Download &amp; Installation</font></b><br>
			The Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in can be downloaded from the <a
				href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-cs/">SourceForge
			project page</a>. The download package consists of a single zip file
			that contains both the Checkstyle plug-in and the Checkstyle core
			engine.<br>
			<br>
			Once you have downloaded the distribution zip file extract its
			contents. Copy the <font face="Courier New">com.atlassw.tools.eclipse.checkstyle_</font><font
				face="Times New Roman"><i>&lt;version&gt;</i></font> folder to your
			Eclipse plug-in folder and restart Eclipse. That's all there is to
			it, you are now ready to run Checkstyle.</p>
			<p><font color="#ff0000"><b><i>Important Note:</i></b></font> If you
			had a pre 3.1.0 version of the Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in installed
			you will need to remove it before installing the new plug-in. Also,
			remove any .checkstyle files from the root of your projects, these
			files are not compatible with this version of the plug-in. After
			removing these files be sure and refresh your workspace so that
			Eclipse is aware that they have been removed.</p>
			<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial">What Next?</font></b><br>
			See the on-line help within Eclipse for more information on how to
			configure and use Checkstyle. To get to the on-line help go the <font
				face="Arial">Help</font> menu and select <font face="Arial">Help
			Contents</font>. Within the help window select the <font face="Arial">Checkstyle</font>
			topic in the left column.</p>
