            <p><b>Introduction</b><br />
             <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a> is a development tool written by Oliver Burn
            to help you ensure that your Java code adheres to a set of coding standards. Checkstyle does this by
            inspecting your Java source code and pointing out items that deviate from a defined set of coding rules.
            The full Checkstyle distribution is included with the plug-in. In addition to using the Eclipse Checkstyle
            plug-in you can also use Checkstyle from the command line or as part of an Ant build.<br />
            <br />
             With the Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in your code is constantly inspected for problems. Within the Eclipse
            workbench you are notified of problems via the Eclipse Problems View and source code annotations just as
            you would see with compiler errors or warnings.</p>

            <p><b>Download &amp; Installation</b><br />
             The Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in can be downloaded from the <a
            href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-cs/">SourceForge project page</a>. The download package
            consists of a single zip file that contains both the Checkstyle plug-in and the Checkstyle core
            engine.<br />
            <br />
             Once you have downloaded the distribution zip file extract its contents. Copy the <font
            face="Courier New">com.atlassw.tools.eclipse.checkstyle_</font><i>&lt;version&gt;</i> folder to your
            Eclipse plug-in folder and restart Eclipse. That's all there is to it, you are now ready to run
            Checkstyle.</p>

            <p><b><i>Important Note:</i></b> Eclipse 2.x.x is no longer supported as of plug-in release 4.0.0.</p>

            <p><b><i>Important Note:</i></b> If you had a pre 3.1.0 version of the Eclipse Checkstyle plug-in installed
            you will need to remove it before installing the new plug-in. Also, remove any .checkstyle files from the
            root of your projects, these files are not compatible with this version of the plug-in. After removing
            these files be sure and refresh your workspace so that Eclipse is aware that they have been removed.</p>

            <p><b><font size="4" face="Arial">What Next?</font></b><br />
             See the on-line help within Eclipse for more information on how to configure and use Checkstyle. To get to
            the on-line help go the <font face="Arial">Help</font> menu and select <font face="Arial">Help
            Contents</font>. Within the help window select the <font face="Arial">Checkstyle</font> topic in the left
            column.</p>
