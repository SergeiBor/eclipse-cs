        <h2>-- New and Noteworthy (5.0.0beta1) --</h2>
        <p>This beta release of the plugin includes the recent Checkstyle 5.0beta1 (read <a
                href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/5.x/releasenotes.html">here</a>)</p>
        <p>The 5.0.0 version of the plugin will be a major restructuring of the existing code. This includes splitting
            the grown, rather monolithic plugin into multiple smaller plugins where future development will be much
            easier to handle (hopefully).<br /> Most of the dissecting and putting-back-together has already taken place
            but is not yet finished.<br />However, on the surface most things will still be where you have come to know
            them. </p>
        <p>After you install the plugin and restart Eclipse the plugin will automatically migrate your
            Checkstyle-enabled projects to the new plugin version. Expect that the <code>.project</code> file of those
            projects to be modified to reflect changes in the plugins package structure.</p>
