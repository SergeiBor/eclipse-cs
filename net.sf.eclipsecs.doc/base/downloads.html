        <h2>-- Download &amp; Installation --</h2>
        <p>The first way to install the Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in is via the <a
                href="http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/update/">update site</a>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Within Eclipse go to <strong>
                    <em>Help-&gt;Software Updates-&gt;Find and Install</em>
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li> Choose <strong>
                    <em>Search for new features to install</em>
                </strong> and press <strong>
                    <em>Next</em>
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li> Create a <strong>
                    <em>New Remote Site...</em>
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li> Input a name to your liking (for instance <i>Checkstyle Plug-in</i>) and input the following URL: <span
                    class="code-blue">http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/update</span>
            </li>
            <li> Click your way through the following pages to install the plug-in. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternatively the Checkstyle Eclipse Plug-in can be downloaded from the <a
                href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-cs/">Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in's SourceForge project
                page</a>. The download package consists of a single zip file that contains both the Checkstyle Plug-in
            and the Checkstyle core engine.</p>
        <p>Once you have downloaded the distribution zip file extract its contents. First, exit from Eclipse. Next, copy
            the <span class="code-blue">com.atlassw.tools.eclipse.checkstyle_<b>&lt;version&gt;</b></span>
            folder to your Eclipse plug-in folder and restart Eclipse. That's all there is to it, you are now ready to
            run Checkstyle.</p>
        <p>
            <b>
                <i>Important Note:</i>
            </b>If you did not use the update site to install the plug-in please make sure to restart Eclipse with the
                <span class="code-blue">-clean</span> option at least once. This is because Eclipse caches a lot of
            information about plug-ins. In case you just updated the plug-in from a previous version this information
            cached by Eclipse is not up to date - resulting in the plug-in failing with ClassNotFoundExceptions and
            other serious issues.</p>
        <p>
            <b>
                <i>Important Note:</i>
            </b>As of plug-in release 4.0.0 only Eclipse 3.0 and newer is supported. Eclipse 2.x.x support is
            discontinued. Please use older plug-in versions with Eclipse 2.x.x. - downloadable from the <a
                href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-cs/">SourceForge Project Page</a>
