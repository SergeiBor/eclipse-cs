        <h2>-- eclipse-cs development environment --</h2>
        <p>It should come to no surprise that eclipse-cs development takes place in Eclipse.<br/>Currently the
            precondition is a Eclipse 3.2 (or newer) with PDE plugin installed.</p>
        <p>Import one of the following team project sets into your workspace, depending on your level of CVS access:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="psf/net.sf.eclipsecs_anonymous.psf">Team project set for Anonymous CVS access</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="psf/net.sf.eclipsecs_ssh.psf">Team project set for committer access (SSH)</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>That should be all for starters.</p>
        <p>If you want to do a binary build of the plugin you need to go to the <code>net.sf.eclipsecs.build</code>
            project, which contains the PDE build for eclipse-cs.</p>
        <p>There adapt properties <code>buildHome</code>, <code>buildDirectory</code> and <code>eclipseDir</code> to
            your local directories.</p>
        <p>After that you should be able to run the build by executing the <code>build.xml</code>, results will appear
            in the directory which you configured as <code>buildDirectory</code>. Note that the build has only been
            tested with Eclipse 3.4 and 3.5, mileage may differ with older Eclipse versions.</p>
