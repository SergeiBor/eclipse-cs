        <h2>Rational Application Developer (RAD) 7/7.5</h2>

        <p>The long standing issues have been finally fixed by IBM. Please update your RAD 7/7.5 installation to the
            latest fixpack.<br/>Thanks to all folks having taken care to report/escalate this issue.</p>

        <h2>Rational Application Developer (RAD) 6 users</h2>

        <p>Note: As of eclipse-cs 5.0.0 RAD 6 is no loner supported. The following information is kept for
            reference.</p>

        <p>Due to a bug in IBMs J9 VM on which RAD runs, out of the box usage of the Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin will with
            almost certainty lead to crashes of RAD.</p>
        <p>The problem is acknowledged by IBM, considering this <a
                href="http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2044&amp;context=SSCM72&amp;dc=DB520&amp;uid=swg21256946&amp;loc=en_US&amp;cs=UTF-8&amp;lang=en&amp;rss=ct2044rational"
                >technote</a>.<br/>However, even as there is a official bug report open at IBM since July 2006 this
            problem has not been fixed yet, although the above mentioned technote seems to point at a specific problem
            location.</p>
        <p>Luckily there are two options to work around the VM crash issues:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Disable the plugins project classloader:</b>
                    <br/>Go to Window->Preferences->Checkstyle and tick the <em>Disable project classloader</em> checkbox.<br/>
                    <b>Important: </b><br/>It is absolutely crucial to do a minor change to your Checkstyle
                    configuration.<br/>There are currently two checks in Checkstyle which load class information of the
                    code to be checked.<br/>Those two checks are <b>JavadocMethod</b> and
                    <b>RedundantThrows</b>.<br/>Both checks have a setting called <b>logLoadErrors</b>, which must be
                    set to <em>true</em>.<br/>Failure to do so will result in Checkstyle throwing RuntimeException on
                    the attempted classloading. These RuntimeExceptions manifest themselves in the plugin as error
                    markes in the checked source files, all with a problem description like: Unable to find class
                    information for XYZ.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><b>Disable J9s class garbage collection:</b><br/>As suggested in the <a
                        href="http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2044&amp;context=SSCM72&amp;dc=DB520&amp;uid=swg21256946&amp;loc=en_US&amp;cs=UTF-8&amp;lang=en&amp;rss=ct2044rational"
                        >technote</a> it is possible to disable J9s class data garbage collection, using the
                        <b>-Xnoclassgc</b> option in eclipse.ini, which is placed in RADs installation folder.<br/>With
                    this option the project classloader <b>does not</b> need to be disabled. The downside however is
                    that RAD accumulates more memory and might run into OutOfMemory errors more often (avg. once per
                    work day - this is my personal experience, mileage my vary).<br/>TODO: add eclipse.ini sample</p>
