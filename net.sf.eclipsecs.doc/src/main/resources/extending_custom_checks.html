        <h2>-- Providing custom checks --</h2>
        <p>One great feature of Checkstyle is its extentablity. You can easily write own checks as explained <a
                href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/writingchecks.html">here</a>.<br/> To hook your checks into the
            eclipse-cs plugin you need to provide them as a plugin themself.</p>
        <p>In the further steps I am - for the sake of simplicity - assuming that you start off with the <a
                href="extending.html">sample plugin</a> the eclipse-cs project provides.<br/>If not then you are
            supposedly proficient enough with eclipse plugin development that you figure on your own. After all it's not
            rocket sience, is it?</p>
        <p>If done correctly, you even will be able to use your plugin jar file for adding your custom checks to a
            Checkstyle Ant/Maven/CmdLine target - without the need for further modification.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Write your custom checks, putting them in your extension projects source folder</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Edit the <code>checkstyle_packages.xml</code> and add the Java package(s) where your custom checks
                    reside there.<br/> In doing so you will be able to define your checks in your configuration file
                    using the logical check name - instead of needing to provide the fully qualified class name of your
                    check.<br/> For more info about the checkstyle packages files please read here: <a
                        href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config.html#Packages"
                        >http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config.html#Packages</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Note that your extension plugin must register itself as buddy to the
                        <code>net.sf.eclipsecs.core</code> plugin, in order for the custom check classes to be loadable
                    by that very plugin.<br/>To do that just make sure the <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> file of
                    your plugin contains this entry: <code>Eclipse-RegisterBuddy: net.sf.eclipsecs.core</code><br/>That
                    is already the case for the sample plugin.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>(Optional) Provide metadata for your custom checks.<br/> By providing metadata your checks will
                    facilitate the full capabilities of the plug-ins configuration editor - this means you will be able
                    to configure them using the plug-in's configuration editor just like the standard checkstyle
                    modules. <br/> To define the metadata you need to write a file named
                        <code>checkstyle-metadata.xml</code> which is to be placed into the package (or packages) your
                    check classed lie in.<br/>
                    <b>In order to let the plug-in find your metadata you need to declare the package within your
                            <code>checkstyle_packages.xml</code> file (see point 2).</b>
                    <br/> The metadata file must adhere to this dtd: <a
                        href="http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/dtds/checkstyle-metadata_1_1.dtd"
                        >http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/dtds/checkstyle-metadata_1_1.dtd</a> . <br/> So it would be a
                    good idea to include this document type declaration to your metadata file:</p>

                <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE checkstyle-metadata 
    PUBLIC &quot;-//eclipse-cs//DTD Check Metadata 1.1//EN&quot;
    &quot;http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/dtds/checkstyle-metadata_1_1.dtd&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>This way you can validate your metadata file against the dtd using your preferred XML editor.</p>
                <p>The dtd file itself contains an abundance of documentation on the tags and their attributes, further
                    further practical reference you may want to peek into the <code>net.sf.eclipsecs.checkstyle</code>
                    plugin, where all the metadata for the standard Checkstyle modules resides.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>If you provided custom metadata for your checks you will be able to fully configure them using the
                    plug-in's configuration editor, after you installed your plugin into your Eclipse.<br/>If you did
                    not provide custom metadata some limitations in the configuration editor will apply: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>You cannot add your custom checks via the configuration editor, because your checks are not
                            known to the plugin.<br/> This means you need to write your checkstyle configuration file by
                            hand using a text editor. Be sure to include all properties of your modules within the
                            module configuration so you can at least edit the properties afterwards in the Checkstyle
                            Plug-in Configuration Editor.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you remove your custom checks from the configuration using the configuration editor you
                            cannot re-add them using the configuration editor.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Your hand added custom checks will show up in the <i>Other</i> section of the configuration
                            editor.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
